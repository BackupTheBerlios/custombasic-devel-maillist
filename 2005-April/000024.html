<PRE>Just a quick update on the state of the runtime, its about halfway
there, I've recently ironed out some problems I was having. I'm
wondering when we're gna start uploading n comparing source code etc,
don' think we are making enough use of the berlios site. For example,
I know that andrew is working on the full interpreter, but i have no
idea what joe is doing at the moment, or where everyone is. Have you
looked at the syntax listing on the wiki? will that command set be
sufficient? if not what extensions need to be made? Would you like a
source snapshot so far (well, of the bit that's finished completely,
the command line parser which passes the commands on to be executed)
and if so where do I send it? or do you not need to see this yet as
you are only concerned with the syntax it will use? I'm off ot bed
now, hopefully i'll get a few minutes tomorrow to spare to get some
more done.
