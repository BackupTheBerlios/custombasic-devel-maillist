<PRE>GMT -06:00 Central USA and Canada time zone.

Is there software out there to help manage developers on a project?
Something to be able to put in a persons timezone, skills, start and
end time available, current group(s) assigned, etc. (like a database)
and be able to assign them tasks (which are e-mailed out) along with
setting up meetings with groups and having a e-mail sent out to every
one with the right time.
In other words being able to select a few times (in your time zone)
and e-mail every one asking which is the best for them. Then they can
e-mail you back with the selected time (based on there time zone) and
boom, your done. All you would have to do is e-mail the final time to
every one (which would be changed for there time zone). It would also
be nice if the software prompted you (in some way) that the selected
time would be to late or to early for some one.
