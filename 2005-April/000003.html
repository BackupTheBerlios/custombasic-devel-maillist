<PRE>I am usually online from 9:00 PM GMT weekdays, though sometimes it can
be as early as 6:00 PM GMT, weekends vary. I have been designing and
playing with various ways to parse the code for the runtime, and I am
thinking that some of the functions for splitting the line up into its
constituent parts should be available to the interpreter as
specialised functions to avoid doing the same work twice over. At the
moment the runtime will incorporate the following commands, tell me if
you think i've missed anything:

variables($ and % string and int support for now)
arithmetic, allocation (x=y and also basic string 'arithmetic'
x$=&quot;Hello &quot; + &quot;World&quot;)
If-Then-Else, AND NOT OR
Goto (Debatable whether for loops/while loops/functions etc should be
included in the runtime, as these could be implemented in the
interpreter using these basic commands)
Print (direct to screen or file)
str$, mid$, val
input (int or string, input masking)
open &lt;filename&gt; for &lt;I/O&gt; as #

These basic commands should be enough to get started with, then there
are morte advanced graphics, locate, cls etc, but these have platform
compatibility issues. Contact me with your thoughts.
