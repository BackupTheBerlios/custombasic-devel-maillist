<PRE>I was only thinking about doing a front end to a database and put some
features into that software. But with what it would turn out to be I
would be building a good management tool. This software would also be
in Visual Basic 6.0 which you want to be in C, I don't know C that
well yet. So, as always before I go coding my hart out and taking on
new problems I look around to see if anyone else has done the same
thing. I came out with three software projects that MIGHT meet most of
our needs for management. That is the positive side, now the negative
part. They all run in a Internet fashion, so it needs to be on a
server (website even) and everyone can login and manage that way. I
know that Sourceforge will allow this type of thing for development,
but I don't know about BOS.
